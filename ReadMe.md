# Assignment 2
The second series of assignments for the Advanced Programming course in Tehran University
'Write a program that contains a Circle, Client, and CreditAccount class'

All of the classes' members are declared in a header file of the same names in the 'includes' folder. Their member functions are defined in a .cpp file of the same name as well.

this program uses enums as a way of hashing the user input in order for it to be used with the switch-case. 

There is also a struct called Account. it is a type of variable that stores information for default CreditAccounts.

all of these defined types are in the 'usr_datatypes.h' file in the 'includes' folder.

Two default CreditAccounts were stored in a Vector and used for testing purposes. 

config.h contains a preprocessor definition of PROFIT_MARGIN for default profit_margin for the CreditAccount class.
